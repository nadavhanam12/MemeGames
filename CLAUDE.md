# MemeGames

Monorepo for small meme-themed web games. First title: **Hormuz Hold'em**
(`Front/`), a Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite browser game. Each future title is
expected to get its own folder; they all share the same backend leaderboard
server.

## Repo layout

- `Front/` — Hormuz Hold'em client (the only game so far).
  - `src/main.ts` — Phaser game bootstrap and scene registration.
  - `src/scenes/` — Boot, Menu, Game, UI, Results, Leaderboard scenes.
  - `src/core/` — game-side systems: `state.ts` (run state + `computeScore()`,
    the canonical submitted score), `art.ts`, `juice.ts`, `sfx.ts`,
    `palette.ts`, `settings.ts`.
  - `src/config/` — `tuning.ts` + `tuning.json` (gameplay values),
    `layout.json` (UI layout), `memes.json` (meme reaction library: templates,
    slot geometry, per-trigger caption variants — picked/rendered by
    `src/core/memes.ts`). Tweak values in the JSON, not in code.
  - `src/backend/` — **the layer between front and back**; see below.
  - `src/dev/` — lil-gui devtools, layout/tuning live-editing helpers.
  - `scripts/art.mjs` (`npm run art`) — asset pipeline (sharp) that processes
    `assets/raw/` per `assets/manifest.json`.
  - `design/ART_DIRECTION.md`, `assets/CHATGPT_BRIEF.md` (core game art),
    `assets/MEME_BRIEF.md` (meme atlas workflow; generation rules + per-cell
    catalog live in `assets/raw/Meme/`) — art direction docs.
- `docs/leaderboard-contract.md` — API contract for the leaderboard server
  (a separate Bun + SQLite repo; consumed over HTTP, no backend code here).

## Front ↔ back layer (`Front/src/backend/`)

Full details in `Front/src/backend/CLAUDE.md` — read it before touching
anything leaderboard-related. Summary:

- The backend is a standalone **leaderboard server** (default
  `http://localhost:3151`, overridable via `VITE_API_BASE` or `configureApi()`)
  with three endpoints: `POST /api/token`, `POST /api/score`,
  `GET /api/leaderboard`.
- `api.ts` is the raw typed HTTP client (game-agnostic, no Phaser),
  `leaderboard.ts` orchestrates the token lifecycle + localStorage
  persistence, `submitOverlay.ts` is the DOM name/email submit form.
- Key contract constraint: score tokens are single-use, IP-bound, and must be
  **≥60s old** at submit time — `GameScene` acquires the token at run start so
  it ages during play.
- The whole `src/backend/` folder is designed to be copied into future
  MemeGames titles unchanged (each game uses its own localStorage key).

## Commands (run inside `Front/`)

- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server.
- `npm run build` — typecheck (`tsc --noEmit`) + production build.
- `npm run art` — regenerate processed assets from `assets/raw/`.

## Conventions

- TypeScript strict, Phaser 3 scene-based architecture.
- Gameplay/UI numbers belong in `src/config/*.json`, not hardcoded.
- Keep `src/backend/` free of game-specific imports so it stays portable.
